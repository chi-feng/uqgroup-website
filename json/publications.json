  "abstract" : "<p>We present a new approach to Bayesian inference that entirely avoids Markov chain simulation, by constructing a map that pushes forward the prior measure to the posterior measure. Existence and uniqueness of a suitable measure-preserving map is established by formulating the problem in the context of optimal transport theory. We discuss various means of explicitly parameterizing the map and computing it efficiently through solution of an optimization problem, exploiting gradient information from the forward model when possible. The resulting algorithm overcomes many of the computational bottlenecks associated with Markov chain Monte Carlo. Advantages of a map-based representation of the posterior include analytical expressions for posterior moments and the ability to generate arbitrary numbers of independent posterior samples without additional likelihood evaluations or forward solves. The optimization approach also provides clear convergence criteria for posterior approximation and facilitates model selection through automatic evaluation of the marginal likelihood. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the approach on nonlinear inverse problems of varying dimension, involving the inference of parameters appearing in ordinary and partial differential equations.</p>",

  "abstract" : "<p>The full application of Bayesian inference to inverse problems requires exploration of a posterior distribution that typically does not possess a standard form. In this context, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are often used. These methods require many evaluations of a computationally intensive forward model to produce the equivalent of one independent sample from the posterior. We consider applications in which approximate forward models at multiple resolution levels are available, each endowed with a probabilistic error estimate. These situations occur, for example, when the forward model involves Monte Carlo integration. We present a novel MCMC method called $MC^3$ that uses low-resolution forward models to approximate draws from a posterior distribution built with the high-resolution forward model. The acceptance ratio is estimated with some statistical error; then a confidence interval for the true acceptance ratio is found, and acceptance is performed correctly with some confidence. The high-resolution models are rarely run and a significant speed up is achieved.</p><p>Our multiple-resolution forward models themselves are built around a new importance sampling scheme that allows Monte Carlo forward models to be used efficiently in inverse problems. The method is used to solve an inverse transport problem that finds applications in atmospheric remote sensing. We present a path-recycling methodology to efficiently vary parameters in the transport equation. The forward transport equation is solved by a Monte Carlo method that is amenable to the use of $MC^3$ to solve the inverse transport problem using a Bayesian formalism.</p>",

  "abstract" : "<p>This paper presents a novel tabulation strategy for the adaptive numerical integration of chemical kinetics using the computational singular perturbation (CSP) method. The strategy stores and reuses CSP quantities required to filter out fast dissipative processes, resulting in a non-stiff chemical source term. In particular, non-parametric regression on low-dimensional slow invariant manifolds (SIMs) in the chemical state space is used to approximate the CSP vectors spanning the fast chemical subspace and the associated fast chemical time-scales. The relevant manifold and its dimension varies depending on the local number of exhausted modes at every location in the chemical state space. Multiple manifolds are therefore tabulated, corresponding to different numbers of exhausted modes (dimensions) and associated radical species. Non-parametric representations are inherently adaptive, and rely on efficient approximate-nearest-neighbor queries. As the CSP information is only a function of the non-radical species in the system and has relatively small gradients in the chemical state space, tabulation occurs in a lower-dimensional state space and at a relatively coarse level, thereby improving scalability to larger chemical mechanisms. The approach is demonstrated on the simulation of homogeneous constant pressure H2–air and CH4–air ignition, over a range of initial conditions. For CH4–air, results are shown that outperform direct implicit integration of the stiff chemical kinetics while maintaining good accuracy.</p>",

  "abstract" : "<p>Truncated Gaussian fields provide a flexible model for defining binary media with dispersed (as opposed to layered) inclusions. General properties of excursion sets on these truncated fields are coupled with a distance-based upscaling algorithm and approximations of point process theory to develop an estimation approach for effective conductivity in two-dimensions. Estimation of effective conductivity is derived directly from knowledge of the kernel size used to create the multiGaussian field, defined as the full-width at half maximum (FWHM), the truncation threshold and conductance values of the two modes. Therefore, instantiation of the multiGaussian field is not necessary for estimation of the effective conductance. The critical component of the effective medium approximation developed here is the mean distance between high conductivity inclusions. This mean distance is characterized as a function of the FWHM, the truncation threshold and the ratio of the two modal conductivities. Sensitivity of the resulting effective conductivity to this mean distance is examined for two levels of contrast in the modal conductances and different FWHM sizes. Results demonstrate that the FWHM is a robust measure of mean travel distance in the background medium. The resulting effective conductivities are accurate when compared to numerical results and results obtained from effective media theory, distance-based upscaling and numerical simulation.</p>",

  "abstract" : "<p>Using high-resolution 3-D vortex simulations, this study seeks a mechanistic understanding of vorticity dynamics in transverse jets at a finite Reynolds number. A full no-slip boundary condition, rigorously formulated in terms of vorticity generation along the channel wall, captures unsteady interactions between the wall boundary layer and the jet – in particular, the separation of the wall boundary layer and its transport into the interior. For comparison, we also implement a reduced boundary condition that suppresses the separation of the wall boundary layer away from the jet nozzle. By contrasting results obtained with these two boundary conditions, we characterize near-field vortical structures formed as the wall boundary layer separates on the backside of the jet. Using various Eulerian and Lagrangian diagnostics, it is demonstrated that several near-wall vortical structures are formed as the wall boundary layer separates. The counter-rotating vortex pair, manifested by the presence of vortices aligned with the jet trajectory, is initiated closer to the jet exit. Moreover tornado-like wall-normal vortices originate from the separation of spanwise vorticity in the wall boundary layer at the side of the jet and from the entrainment of streamwise wall vortices in the recirculation zone on the lee side. These tornado-like vortices are absent in the case where separation is suppressed. Tornado-like vortices merge with counter-rotating vorticity originating in the jet shear layer, significantly increasing wall-normal circulation and causing deeper jet penetration into the crossflow stream.</p>",

Attention is focused on the simplified problem of extracting the diffusivity, D, in an isothermal system at high temperature. To this end, a mixing measure theory is developed that relies on analyzing the moments of the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the constituents. The mixing measures obtained from replica simulations are exploited in a Bayesian inference framework, based on contrasting these measures with corresponding moments of a dimensionless concentration evolving according to a Fickian process. The noise inherent in the MD simulations is described as a Gaussian process, and this hypothesis is verified both a priori and using a posterior predictive check. Computed values of D for an initially unmixed system rapidly heated to 1500 K are found to be consistent with experimental correlation for diffusion of Ni into molten Al. On the contrary, large discrepancies with experimental predictions are observed when D is estimated based on large-time mean-square displacement (MSD) analysis, and when it is evaluated using the Arrhenius correlation calibrated against experimental measurements of self-propagating front velocities. Implications are finally drawn regarding extension of the present work and potential refinement of continuum modeling approaches.</p>",

Inferring some important details of the attack quickly, for example, the number of people infected, the time of infection, and a representative dose received can be crucial to planning a medical response. We use a Bayesian approach, based on a short time series of diagnosed patients, to estimate a joint probability density for these parameters. We first test the formulation with idealized cases and then apply it to realistic scenarios, including the Sverdlovsk anthrax outbreak of 1979. We also use simulated outbreaks to explore the impact of model error, as when the model used for generating simulated epidemic curves does not match the model subsequently used to characterize the attack. We find that in all cases except for the smallest attacks (fewer than 100 infected people), 3–5 days of data are sufficient to characterize the outbreak to a specificity that is useful for directing an emergency response.</p>",

  "abstract" : "<p>We study the convergence characteristics of two algebraic kernels used in vortex calculations: the Rosenhead–Moore kernel, which is a low-order kernel, and the Winckelmans–Leonard kernel, which is a high-order kernel. To facilitate the study, a method of evaluating particle-cluster interactions is introduced for the Winckelmans–Leonard kernel. The method is based on Taylor series expansion in Cartesian coordinates, as initially proposed by Lindsay and Krasny [J. Comput. Phys., 172 (2001), pp. 879–907] for the Rosenhead–Moore kernel. A recurrence relation for the Taylor coefficients of the Winckelmans–Leonard kernel is derived by separating the kernel into two parts, and an error estimate is obtained to ensure adaptive error control. The recurrence relation is incorporated into a tree-code to evaluate vorticity-induced velocity. Next, comparison of convergence is made while utilizing the tree-code. Both algebraic kernels lead to convergence, but the Winckelmans–Leonard kernel exhibits a superior convergence rate. The combined desingularization and discretization error from the Winckelmans–Leonard kernel is an order of magnitude smaller than that from the Rosenhead–Moore kernel at a typical resolution. Simulations of vortex rings are performed using the two algebraic kernels in order to compare their performance in a practical setting. In particular, numerical simulations of the side-by-side collision of two identical vortex rings suggest that the three-dimensional evolution of vorticity at finite resolution can be greatly affected by the choice of the kernel. We find that the Winckelmans–Leonard kernel is able to perform the same task with a much smaller number of vortex elements than the Rosenhead–Moore kernel, greatly reducing the overall computational cost.</p>",

Computational challenges in this construction arise from the need for repeated evaluations of the forward model (e.g., in the context of Markov chain Monte Carlo) and are compounded by high dimensionality of the posterior. We address these challenges by introducing truncated Karhunen–Loève expansions, based on the prior distribution, to efficiently parameterize the unknown field and to specify a stochastic forward problem whose solution captures that of the deterministic forward model over the support of the prior. We seek a solution of this problem using Galerkin projection on a polynomial chaos basis, and use the solution to construct a reduced-dimensionality surrogate posterior density that is inexpensive to evaluate.

The ability to simulate a large number of samples from the posterior distribution results in very accurate estimates of the inverse solution and its associated uncertainty. Combined with high accuracy of the gPC-based forward solver, the new algorithm can provide great efficiency in practical applications. A rigorous error analysis of the algorithm is conducted, where we establish convergence of the approximate posterior to the true posterior and obtain an estimate of the convergence rate. It is proved that fast (exponential) convergence of the gPC forward solution yields similarly fast (exponential) convergence of the posterior.

We develop a high-resolution three-dimensional vortex simulation of the transverse jet at large Reynolds number and consider jet-to-crossflow velocity ratios r ranging from 5 to 10. A new formulation of vorticity-flux boundary conditions accounts for the interaction of channel wall vorticity with the jet flow immediately around the orifice. We demonstrate that the nascent jet shear layer contains not only azimuthal vorticity generated in the jet pipe, but wall-normal and azimuthal perturbations resulting from the jet–crossflow interaction. This formulation also yields analytical expressions for vortex lines in the near field as a function of $r$.</p><p>Transformation of the cylindrical shear layer emanating from the orifice begins with axial elongation of its lee side to form sections of counter-rotating vorticity aligned with the jet trajectory. Periodic roll-up of the shear layer accompanies this deformation, creating complementary vortex arcs on the lee and windward sides of the jet. Counter-rotating vorticity then drives lee-side roll-ups in the windward direction, along the normal to the jet trajectory. Azimuthal vortex arcs of alternating sign thus approach each other on the windward boundary of the jet. Accordingly, initially planar material rings on the shear layer fold completely and assume an interlocking structure that persists for several diameters above the jet exit. Though the near field of the jet is dominated by deformation and periodic roll-up of the shear layer, the resulting counter-rotating vorticity is a pronounced feature of the mean field; in turn, the mean counter-rotation exerts a substantial influence on the deformation of the shear layer. Following the pronounced bending of the trajectory into the crossflow, we observe a sudden breakdown of near-field vortical structures into a dense distribution of smaller scales. Spatial filtering of this region reveals the persistence of counter-rotating streamwise vorticity initiated in the near field.</p>",

Weighted k-means partitions minimize the sum of clusters’ second moments and create well-localized domains, and thus reduce the computational cost of N-body approximations by enabling the use of lower-order approximations and fewer cells.</p><p>We also introduce compatible techniques for dynamic load balancing, including adaptive scaling of cluster volumes and adaptive redistribution of cluster centroids. We demonstrate the performance of these algorithms by constructing a parallel treecode for vortex particle simulations, based on the serial variable-order Cartesian code developed by Lindsay and Krasny [Journal of Computational Physics 172 (2) (2001) 879–907]. The method is applied to vortex simulations of a transverse jet. Results show outstanding parallel efficiencies even at high concurrencies, with velocity evaluation errors maintained at or below their serial values; on a realistic distribution of 1.2 million vortex particles, we observe a parallel efficiency of 98% on 1024 processors. Excellent load balance is achieved even in the face of several obstacles, such as an irregular, time-evolving particle distribution containing a range of length scales and the continual introduction of new vortex particles throughout the domain. Moreover, results suggest that k-means yields a more efficient partition of the domain than a global oct-tree.</p>",

  "abstract" : "<p>Combustion in turbulent flows may take the form of a thin flame wrapped around vortical structures. For this regime, the flame embedding approach seeks to decouple computations of the outer nonreacting flow and the combustion zone by discretizing the flame surface into a number of elemental flames, each incorporating the local impact of unsteady flow-flame interaction. An unsteady strained laminar flame solver, based on a boundary-layer approximation of combustion in a time-dependent stagnation-point potential flow, is proposed as an elemental flame model. To validate the concept, two-dimensional simulations of premixed flame-vortex interactions are performed for a matrix of vortex strengths and length scales, and a section of the flame is selected for comparison with the flame embedding model results. Results show that using the flame leading-edge strain rate gives reasonable agreement in the cases of low strain rate and weak strain rate gradient within the flame structure. This agreement deteriorates substantially when both are high. We propose two different schemes, both based on averaging the strain rate across the flame structure, and demonstrate that agreement between the one-dimensional model and the two-dimensional simulation greatly improves when the actual strain rate at the reaction zone of the one-dimensional flame is made to match that of the two-dimensional flame.</p>",

  "abstract" : "<p>Premixed flames encounter gradients of mixture equivalence ratio in stratified charge engines, lean premixed gas-turbine engines, and a variety of other applications. In cases for which the scales—spatial or temporal—of fuel concentration gradients in the reactants are comparable to flame scales, changes in burning rate, flammability limits, and flame structure have been observed. This paper uses an unsteady strained flame in the stagnation point configuration to examine the effect of temporal gradients on combustion in a premixed methane/air mixture. An inexact Newton backtracking method, coupled with a preconditioned Krylov subspace iterative solver, was used to improve the efficiency of the numerical solution and expand its domain of convergence in the presence of detailed chemistry.</p><p>Results indicate that equivalence ratio variations with timescales lower than 10 ms have significant effects on the burning process, including reaction zone broadening, burning rate enhancement, and extension of the flammability limit toward learner mixtures. While the temperature of a flame processing a stoichiometric-to-lean equivalence ratio gradient decreased slightly within the front side of the reaction zone, radical concentrations remained elevated over the entire flame structure. These characteristics are linked to a feature reminiscent of “back-supported” flames—flames in which a stream of products resulting from burning at higher equivalence ratio is continuously supplied to lower equivalence ratio reactants. The relevant feature is the establishment of a positive temperature gradient on the products side of the flame which maintains the temperature high enough and the radical concentration sufficient to sustain combustion there. Unsteadiness in equivalence ratio produces similar gradients within the flame structure, thus compensating for the change in temperature at the leading edge of the reaction zone and accounting for an observed “flame inertia”. For sufficiently large equivalence ratio gradients, a flame starting in a stoichiometric mixture can burn through a very lean one by taking advantage of this mechanism.</p>",

  "abstract" : "<p>Autocorrelation of a double-exposed image, unlike cross-correlation between two images, produces a correlation function that is symmetric about the origin. Thus, while it is possible to calculate the speed and direction of tracer particles in a particle image velocimetry (PIV) image using autocorrelation, it is impossible to tell whether the velocity is in the positive or negative direction. This ambiguity can be resolved by spatially shifting one exposure relative to the next or labeling exposures with color or polarization, but the complexity and limitations of these methods can be prohibitive. It is, however, possible to resolve the sign of the velocity from a triple-exposed image using unequal time intervals between exposures.</p><p>Triple-exposed images, like double-exposed images, correlate symmetrically about zero. The directional ambiguity, however, can be resolved by calculating the probability that the three exposures occur in a specific temporal order; that is, by assuming that the correlation has a specific sign and testing to see if the assumption is correct. Traditional spectral and statistical correlation techniques are unable to accomplish this. Presented herein is a computationally efficient asymmetric correlation function that is able to differentiate the temporal order of triple exposed images. Included is a discussion of the limitations of this function and of difficulties in experimental implementation.</p>",
