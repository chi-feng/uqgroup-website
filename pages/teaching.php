    <strong>16.940: Numerical Methods for Stochastic Modeling and Inference</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Offered Spring 2010, Spring 2012, Spring 2014</p>
  <p>
    Advanced introduction to numerical methods for treating uncertainty in computational simulation. Draws examples from a range of engineering and science applications, emphasizing systems governed by ordinary and partial differential equations. Uncertainty propagation and assessment: Monte Carlo methods, variance reduction, sensitivity analysis, adjoint methods, polynomial chaos and Karhunen-Lo√®ve expansions, and stochastic Galerkin and collocation methods. Interaction of models with observational data, from the perspective of statistical inference: Bayesian parameter estimation, statistical regularization, Markov chain Monte Carlo, sequential data assimilation and filtering, and model selection.

    <strong>16.100: Aerodynamics</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Offered Fall 2009, 2010, 2011; Fall 2013</p>
  <p>
    Extends fluid mechanic concepts from Unified Engineering to aerodynamic performance of wings and bodies in sub/supersonic regimes. Subject generally has four components: subsonic potential flows, including source/vortex panel methods; viscous flows, including laminar and turbulent boundary layers; aerodynamics of airfoils and wings, including thin airfoil theory, lifting line theory, and panel method/interacting boundary layer methods; and supersonic and hypersonic airfoil theory. Material may vary somewhat each year depending upon focus of design problem. Elementary usage of MATLAB and other computational tools expected.

    <strong>16.90: Computational Methods in Aerospace Engineering</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Offered Spring 2009, 2010, 2011</p>
  <p>
    Introduction to computational techniques arising in aerospace engineering. Techniques include numerical integration of systems of ordinary differential equations; numerical discretization of partial differential equations; and probabilistic methods for quantifying the impact of variability. Specific emphasis will be given to finite volume methods in fluid mechanics, and energy and finite element methods in structural mechanics.
