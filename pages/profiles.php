  I am interested in uncertainty quantification with Polynomial Chaos. My research includes the convergence analysis of numerical algorithms based on the stochastic Galerkin approach as well as structure preserving transformations for the Galerkin projected system. Moreover, I am interested in Compressive Sensing and robust optimization based on derivative free methods. I received my doctoral degree in Mathematics from the TUM (Munich, Germany) in 2011.

My research aims to extend the Bayesian optimal design framework to cases where the predictive model is incomplete or incorrect. I am seeking my master's degree in the Computation for Design and Optimization program. I received a bachelor's degree in Physics from the California Institute of Technology, where I did a SURF in the Caltech PSAAP program. Outside of my work, I am interested in photography, piano, and web design.
