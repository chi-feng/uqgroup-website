<h3>Optimal Bayesian Experimental Design</h3>
<div class="blurb">
  <p>Not all experiments are created equal, some are more valuable than others. Performing experiments under conditions that maximize the value of data thus would lead to substantial resource savings. We develop a general mathematical framework and an algorithmic approach for optimal experimental design with nonlinear simulation-based models; in particular, we focus on finding sets of experiments that provide the most information about targeted sets of model parameters.</p>

<h3>Bayesian Inversion using Optimal Maps (MCMC-free)</h3>
<div class="blurb">
  <p>By reinterpreting Bayesian inversion as a transformation from the prior random variable to the posterior random variable, we have developed an efficient, exact optimization algorithm to compute the map (without Markov chains). Advantages include error measures and conversions criteria, which enable analytic computation of posterior statistics, efficient propagation of posterior knowledge, parallelizable, evidence computed for free.</p>
