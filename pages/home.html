<h2>Introduction</h2>
    
<p>Welcome to the Uncertainty Quantification Group, in the <a href="http://aeroastro.mit.edu/">Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics</a> at <a href="http://mit.edu">MIT</a>. We are part of the <a href="http://acdl.mit.edu/">Aerospace Computational Design Laboratory</a> and affiliated with the <a href="http://computationalengineering.mit.edu/">Center for Computational Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>
We'd like to invite you to explore the site, and do contact us if you find something interesting. <br />
Stop by if you happen to be in Cambridge, or perhaps we'll see you at a conference soon!

<h3 id="research-overview">Research Overview</h2>

<p>Our research focuses on advancing fundamental computational methodology for uncertainty quantification and statistical inference in complex physical systems, and using these tools to address challenges in modeling energy conversion and environmental applications.</p>

<p>We tackle a broad range of projects, but most involve aspects of a few core questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to quantify confidence in computational predictions?</li> 
  <li>How to build or refine models of complex physical processes from indirect and limited observations?</li>
  <li>What information is needed to drive inference, design, and control?</li>
</ul>
